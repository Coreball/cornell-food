# Cornell Dining in the Pandemic

This is the repository for Cornell Dining in the Pandemic, a project to tell the story of how Cornell Dining evolved and responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the eyes of a student: me (Changyuan Lin). There are 887 personal photographs in this collection, spanning Fall 2019 to Fall 2022.

The website is available at <https://www.changyuan.me/cornell-food/> and was built with the Svelte + TS + Vite template.
